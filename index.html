    <h1 class="title text-center">Explicit content in albanian music</h1>
    <p class="subtitle text-center">This project is about Albanian music and artists. We want to show how many songs are not appropriate for all listeners and how many are okay. We used d3.js to make charts and graphs. We have data about 50 songs from 35 singers. We will look at each singer and see how many songs they have that are not appropriate. We hope to learn more about Albanian music and how much of it is not for everyone.</p>

      <h6 class="text-center">Danceability</h6>
      <p class="text-center">Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p>

      <h6 class="text-center energy-nav-title">Loudness</h6>
      <p class="text-center">The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.</p>

      <h6 class="text-center energy-nav-title">Energy</h6>
      <p class="text-center">Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p>

      <h6 class="text-center energy-nav-title">Valence</h6>
      <p class="text-center">A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</p>
